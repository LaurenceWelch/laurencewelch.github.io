## gerryvanboven's get the passcode
After opening the file in Ghidra, I navigated to the main function. The main function uses `scanf` to get user input. It then compares this input to a local variable. This local variable is set in the beginning of the function.
```c
local_c = 0x130104
```
Later on in the main function, the local variable and the scanned variable are compared; if they are equal the file is cracked. Python can be used to retrieve the decimal value of local_c.
```bash
python3
```
```python
int("130104", base=16)
```
